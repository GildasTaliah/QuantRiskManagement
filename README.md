## Insurance Claim Fraud Detection Leveraging Machine Learning

This project focuses on developing a Machine Learning model to detect fraudulent insurance claims using models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and a Voting Classifier. The goal is to improve fraud detection accuracy and reduce false positives to minimize operational risks.

The dataset contains 1,000 observations with 39 features, such as customer tenure and the availability of police reports. On the test set, Gradient Boosting performed best with 78.8% accuracy, while the Voting Classifier achieved 74%. However, the precision scores indicate a need for further refinement to enhance detection capabilities.
